This repository holds my 3rd year session project at Polytechnique Montreal. 

In order to make it work correctly you are required to use a crazyfly drone from bitcraze (https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/)

The goal of this project was to program two of such drones to fly in an enclosed area at the same time all the while
they would scan their surroundings. The information gathered by the drones would then be sent to a groundstation 
(a closeby laptop) that would then use said information to map out the area the drones were put in.

The groundstation was also able to send various commands to the drones and see their status.

There is also a simulation folder that is able to simulate the crazyfly drones (and a higher number of them) on the groundstation.


The grade that was gotten on this project was a B+
