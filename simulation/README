In simulation folder, after installing all the prerequisite asked by ARGoS, start by executing the following:
$ mkdir build && cd build

The following commands are to be repeated everytime there is a change with the code, except when the change is in .argos, where only the last of those commands need to be executed:
to build code that is debuggable 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
to build code in release mode (quicker compilation)
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 

if not in "build" folder, go there first.
$ make -j $(nproc)
$ cd ..
$ argos3 -c experiments/crazyflie_sensing.argos

if in the folder "simulation" and folder "build" is already existing, this command will do it all at once:
$ cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make -j $(nproc) && cd .. ; argos3 -c experiments/crazyflie_sensing.argos
